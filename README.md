INTRODUCTION:
-------------
	GPS-based Pilot Guidance System is a simplistic interface encapsulating both hardware and software with the aim to 
	provide navigational informations to the aircraft pilot in conducting ariel surveys for explorations and otherwise 
	activities. The system interfaces GPS sensor and RADAR altimeter to gather positional as well as Above Ground 
	Level (AGL) height. The data acquisition hardware is designed using PC-104 architecture of embedded computer 
	standards. The software provides a simple graphical interface displaying maps and different navigation information required.
